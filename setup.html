                    This page explains how I created my robot, including hardware and software installation. Follow
                    these steps if you want to create your own.
                    The latest version of the robot includes many physical components and software that you may not be
                    interested in, in terms of capabilities. The guide will follow my development in chronological
                    order, but if you know what you are doing, you can skip sections, use alternative hardware, and so
                    on. I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do in the beginning, but if you plan to copy
                    this project, it may be cheaper to only buy the parts that are in the final robot, not every
                    component listed.
                    <br>
                    As an advice, if you have to power-on the robot while cables are connected to it, make sure the
                    wheels are off the ground. In this way, even if it starts moving it won't cause damage.

                    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-6">The original robot</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">I started my project from Yahboom's <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">RDK X3 Robot</a> (the version without the depth camera), which is already a fully functioning robot (you have to assemble it however) with a lot of capabilities.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Brief introduction</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        RDK X3 has 4 mecanum wheels, which give it the ability to move in any direction. For sensors, it has a
                        camera, a lidar, and other internal sensors that I still have not experimented with, like IMU. It has a
                        buzzer that can emit a beeping sound and a small oled screen that displays information about the robot.
                        it also comes with a handy, wireless PS2-like controller. The main computer is a RDK X3 development board, which
                        is similar to a Raspberry Pi.
                        <br>
                        The robot has already many sophisticated capabilities, such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And
                        Mapping), which allows it to map its environment and navigate autonomously. It can also follow a line, avoid
                        obstacles, and recognize objects. Most of them are implemented as ROS2 packages, which is a framework for
                        building robotic applications.
                        The <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">official documentation</a>
                        linked above enters into the details about all the hardware and software, if you are interested.

                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">PC connection</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        To access the robot OS from a computer there are several ways, but what I found most convenient is with
                        RealVNC viewer, which is a remote desktop application. Note, however, that the robot has to already be connected
                        to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. To do this I connected a screen, a mouse, and a keyboard via cable directly to the robot,
                        and then I configured the Wi-Fi network from the desktop environment.

                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Issues</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                        <li>The smartphone apps provided by Yahboom didn't work in my case (the robot should be controllable by phone).</li>
                        <li>I had trouble with the advanced capabilities, in part because my pc has Windows, so I had to use a virtual machine with Ubuntu to run ROS. But even then, sometimes they didn't work as expected.</li>
                        <li>The robot could not translate to the left or the right as it should (thanks to the mecanum wheels). Two of the wheels on a diagonal line were a bit elevated, almost not touching the ground. I didn't find the origin, maybe it was how I attached the motors to the chassis, or the chassis itself was a bit bent. Thankfully, the bigger chassis didn't have this problem.</li>
                        <li>The RDK X3 Robot arrived with a defective IMX2...</li>

                        In this section are listed many small upgrades (hardware and software) to the RDK X3 robot. For the more complex
                        modifications each one has a dedicated section.

                    <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Oled screen</h4>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        The oled screen is a small display that shows information about the robot, it has low resolution and a very
                        limited number of characters that can be displayed at once, but it is useful to show the status of the robot
                        when you cant connect to it with a computer or a smartphone.
