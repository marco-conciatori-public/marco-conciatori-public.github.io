                    This guide will explain step by step how to recreate my robot, including hardware and software.
                    I will explain in very fine detail how to set up the robot OS, install all the necessary libraries,
                    and run the code, because it is not simple and even small mistakes can lead to hours of debugging.
                    About the hardware, I will explain what components I used, but I won't go
                    into too much detail about how to assemble the robot, because I had to do a lot of trial and error
                    and manual adjustments (like adding new holes in the large chassis) that are difficult to explain.
                    <br>
                    Keep in mind this will only work for my latest version of the robot, which may include capabilities
                    you are not interested into, or require hardware that you don't have. If you want to make your own
                    changes, you will probably need to also change some code or libraries in the OS. For example, if you
                    only want to work with the RDK X3 robot without any physical addition, you could find the correct
                    commit of my GitHub repository that works with the original robot and use that, but I make no
                    guarantee it will have no problems.
                    <br>
                    As an advice, if you have to power-on the robot while cables are connected to it, make sure the
                    wheels are off the ground. In this way, even if it starts moving it won't cause damage.

                        To access the robot OS from a computer there are several ways, but what I found most convenient
                        is with RealVNC viewer, which is a remote desktop application. Note, however, that the robot
                        I started my project from Yahboom's
                        <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">RDK X3 Robot</a>
                        (the version without the depth camera), which is already a fully functioning robot (you have to
                        assemble it however) with a lot of capabilities.
                        has to already be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. To do this, I connected
                        a screen, mouse, and keyboard via cable directly to the robot, and then I connected to my
                        Wi-Fi network from the robot's OS.
