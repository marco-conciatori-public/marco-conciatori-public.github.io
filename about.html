                            Hi, I'm Marco, a Python programmer and AI expert. I have always been interested in AI, in
                            particular AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). I did a PhD in Civil Engineering, about
                            applying AI to Civil Engineering tasks (landslide forecasting). Coming from a background
                            in theory and research, this project was a first for meâ€”a chance to build something purely
                            for entertainment and to test new technologies in a hands-on way.

                <p class="standard-text">
                    For two projects during my PhD, I had to develop object detection and tracking algorithms. At first,
                    I tried to develop Neural Networks from scratch, but after I compared them with big, pre-trained
                    models, I realized that they were <strong>much</strong> better. Even in cases where I had to adapt
                    the NNs to different domains, with just a little fine-tuning they performed way better than new
                    models. And it is not just in comparison with my models, the best object recognition algorithms are
                    amazing, more than I previously realized.
                    So I started to think about how to use them in a practical way (for fun), and I thought about
                    a robot. With object detection, it could recognize objects and people and do something with that
                    information. But aside from this vague idea I had not a clear direction for what I wanted to do.
                    <br><br>
                    I started to look for robot kits with good hardware and that allowed programming. I found the
                    Yahboom RDK X3, which had a good balance between price and performance, and I started from it.
                    <br><br>
                    While developing, more ideas kept coming to mind, and I tried to implement them. I also received
                    as gift from friends various hardware components, like the robotic arm and the ReSpeaker Mic Array
                    v2.0, which allowed new features and gave me new ideas and objectives.
                    <br><br>
                    Ideally I would have liked to make the robot fully autonomous, but the models required for voice
                    interaction (reasoning and Text-to-Speech) are far too big to run on the robot, so that part uses
                    an internet connection to Google's Gemini API. Aside from that the robot is fully autonomous, even
                    object detection is done on-board.

                    Building Mantis required more languages and technologies than I initially assumed.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Python:</strong> most of the code is written in Python. Both because the original RDK X3
                        codebase was in Python, and because it is the programming language I am most comfortable with.
                    </li>

                        <strong><a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="standard-link">ROS2</a>
                            (Robot Operating System):</strong> I had to learn it from scratch, and it was not super
                        easy, but it was necessary. Some components, like the lidar, can only communicate through ROS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bash scripting:</strong> I had to write some bash scripts to automate tasks on the
                        robot, like starting the main program on boot. And when ROS was involved the scripts became more
                        complicated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unity/C#:</strong> I had to learn the basics of Unity and C# to create the app for
                        controlling the robot with the VR headset. It was not super difficult, but the libraries for
                        the VR interaction were not very stable and documented, so that required some trial and error.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> even the website was basically my first experience with
                        web development. But in this case, it was mostly created AND designed by Gemini, I just
                        modified small parts of the code and added the content.

                    You can find the complete source code for the robot on my GitHub. It is separated into two
                    repositories: one for the Jetson Nano board (only voice interaction at the moment), and one for the
                    RDK X3 board (everything else). I also made two attempts at creating a smartphone app to control the
                    robot. They were not successful, and they are suspended for now, but you can find the code if you
                    are interested.
