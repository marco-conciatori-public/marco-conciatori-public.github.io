            This section explains how I created my robot, including hardware and software installation. Follow these
            steps if you want to create your own.
            <br>
            The latest robot includes many physical components and software that you may not be interested in, in terms
            of capabilities. The guide will follow my development in chronological order, but if you know what you are
            doing, you can skip sections, use alternative hardware, and so on. I didn't have a clear idea of what I
            wanted to do in the beginning, but if you plan to copy this project, it may be cheaper to only buy the
            parts that are in the final robot, not every component listed.
            <br>
            As an advice, if you have to power on the robot with cables connected to it, make sure the wheels are not
            touching the ground. In this way, even if it starts moving it won't cause damage.

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The original robot</h3>
        I started my project from Yahboom's <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">RDK X3 Robot</a>
        (the version without the depth camera), which is already a fully functioning robot (you have to assemble it however) with a lot of capabilities.
        <img src="../assets/setup/original_robot.png" alt="Original Robot" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Brief introduction</h4>
        RDK X3 has 4 mechanum wheels, which give it the ability to move in any direction. For sensors, it has a
        camera, a lidar, and other internal sensors that I still have not experimented with, like IMU. It has a
        buzzer that can emit a beeping sound and a small oled screen that displays information about the robot.
        it also comes with a handy, wireless PS2-like controller. The main computer is a RDK X3 development board, which
        is similar to a Raspberry Pi.
        <br>
        The robot has already many sophisticated capabilities, such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And
        Mapping), which allows it to map its environment and navigate autonomously. It can also follow a line, avoid
        obstacles, and recognize objects. Most of them are implemented as ROS2 packages, which is a framework for
        building robotic applications.
        The <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">official documentation</a>
        linked above enters into the details about all the hardware and software, if you are interested.

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">PC connection</h4>
        To access the robot OS from a computer there are several ways, but what I found most convenient is with
        RealVNC viewer, which is a remote desktop application. Note, however, that the robot has to already be connected
        to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. To do this I connected a screen, a mouse, and a keyboard via cable directly to the robot,
        and then I configured the Wi-Fi network from the desktop environment.

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Issues</h4>
        I had some issues with the robot, which I will list here so you will be prepared in advance.
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>The smartphone apps provided by Yahboom didn't work in my case (the robot should be controllable by phone).</li>
            <li>I had trouble with the advanced capabilities, in part because my pc has Windows, so I had to use
                a virtual machine with Ubuntu to run ROS. But even then, sometimes they didn't work as expected.</li>
            <li>The robot could not translate to the left and the right as it should thanks to the mechanum wheels. Two
                of the wheels on a diagonal line were a bit elevated, almost not touching the ground. I didn't find the
                origin, maybe it was how I attached the motors to the chassis, or the chassis itself was a bit bent.
                Thankfully, the bigger chassis didn't have this problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Software</h4>
        I started by changing small bits of code while I was trying to understand how the robot worked. For example, I
        added the control of the internal lights to the PS2 controller and changed some of the information
        displayed on the oled screen.
        <br>
        In the end I wrote almost all the code from scratch, but I still use some of the original code, for example
        the functions to send commands to hardware components like the motors, screen, buzzer, and so on. You can
        find the code in my <a href="https://github.com/marco-conciatori-public?tab=repositories" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">GitHub repository</a>.
        There is more than one repository related to the robot
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li> <b>yahboom_rdk_x3_robot</b> contains the code for the robot's main computer (RDK X3 development board), it is mostly python with
                some bash scripts. Actually, all my code is in the "sunriseRobot" folder, I kept the original folder
                structure with all of Yahboom's code because I find it useful as a reference while programming. Remember
                to switch to the latest branch (currently it is "arm_inverse_kinematics"). The other useful part of the
                repository is the "src" folder where my ROS2 packages are kept.</li>
            <li> <b>voice_robot_interaction</b> contains the code for the voice interaction with the robot. It is meant
                to be run on the second computer on the robot, the Jetson Nano, just because I had it available (it came
                with the robotic arm). It helps to offload some of the processing from the main computer and uses the
                arm camera to avoid conflicts, but it is not strictly necessary. Note that if you want to run it on the
                main computer you have to change a good portion of the code and install the required libraries.</li>
            <li> <b>robot_remote_control</b> and <b>robot_remote_control_2</b> were attempts to create a smartphone
                application to control and monitor the robot, but I have no experience in mobile development and
                for now they are not functional.</li>
            <li> <b>marco-conciatori-public.github.io</b> is the repository for this website, it contains the code for the
                pages you are reading now.</li>
        </ul>
        There are still many features to add (es. the smartphone app mentioned above), inefficiencies to improve (es.
        the inverse kinematics computation), bugs to solve, and the code could be better organized. If you want to
        contribute, feel free to fork the repositories and make a pull request, I will be happy to review it. Or just
        send advices: I am a python programmer, expert on AI, but this was my first experience with robotics, ROS/ROS2,
        smartphone applications, and Unity/C#, so I expect many things could be improved. Even this is the first
        website I create (thanks Gemini)!

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Robot's upgrades</h3>
        In this section are listed many small upgrades (hardware and software) to the RDK X3 robot. For the more complex
        modifications each one has a dedicated section.

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Oled screen</h4>
        The oled screen is a small display that shows information about the robot, it has low resolution and a very
        limited number of characters that can be displayed at once, but it is useful to show the status of the robot
        when you cant connect to it with a computer or a smartphone.
