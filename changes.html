                    This page explains everything that I introduced or changed about Mantis, including hardware and
                    software. The list will follow my development in chronological order. I didn't have a clear idea of
                    what I wanted to do in the beginning, I just kept adding features that I found interesting, or
                    modifying existing ones to improve them.

                    <h3 class="section_title">The Original Robot</h3>
                    <p class="standard_text">I started my project from Yahboom's <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="standard_link">RDK X3 Robot</a> (the version without the depth camera), which is already a fully functioning robot (you have to assemble it however) with a lot of capabilities.</p>

                    <h4 class="section_subtitle">Brief introduction</h4>
                    <p class="standard_text">
                        RDK X3 has 4 mecanum wheels, which give it the ability to move in any direction. For sensors,
                        it has a camera, a lidar, and other internal sensors that I still have not experimented with,
                        like IMU. It has a buzzer that can emit a beeping sound and a small oled screen that displays
                        information about the robot. It also comes with a handy, wireless PS2-like controller. The main
                        computer is a RDK X3 development board, which is similar to a Raspberry Pi.
                        <br>
                        The robot has already many sophisticated capabilities, such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization
                        AndMapping), which allows it to map its environment and navigate autonomously. It can also
                        follow a line, avoid obstacles, and recognize objects. Most of them are implemented as ROS2
                        packages, which is a framework for building robotic applications.
                        The <a href="https://www.yahboom.net/study/RDK-X3-Robot" class="standard_link">official documentation</a>
                        linked above enters into the details about all the hardware and software, if you are interested.

                    <h4 class="section_subtitle">Issues</h4>
                    <ul class="first-level">
                        <li>The smartphone apps provided by Yahboom didn't work in my case (the robot should be controllable by phone).</li>
                        <li>I had trouble with the advanced capabilities, in part because my pc is Windows, so I had to
                            use a virtual machine with Ubuntu to run ROS. But even then, sometimes they didn't work as
                            expected.</li>
                        <li>The robot could not strafe to the left or the right as it should (thanks to the mecanum
                            wheels). Two of the wheels on a diagonal line were a bit elevated, almost not touching the
                            ground. I didn't find the source of the problem, maybe it was how I attached the motors to
                            the chassis, or the chassis itself was a bit bent. Thankfully, the bigger chassis that I
                            switched to, didn't have this issue.</li>
                        <li>The camera is frontal and without protections, be careful when driving the robot.</li>
                        <li>The RDK X3 Robot arrived with a defective IMX2 camera. It worked (so it took me a lot of
                            time to notice the problem), but the images were very blurry. The client support was very
                            helpful and efficient: after a check, they agreed to send me a new camera free of charge.
                            It also arrived quite fast, considering it was sent from Cina.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="standard_text">
                        The oled screen is a small display that shows information about the robot, it has low resolution and a very
                        limited number of characters can be displayed at once, but it is useful to show the status of the robot
                        when you cant connect it to a computer or smartphone.

                        In the original version of the robot, the 4 lines of text available were used to show:</p>

                    <p class="standard_text">I changed it to display:</p>

                        <li>current mode and sub-mode e.g. "User Controlled (wheels)"</li>

                        Moreover, line 2 and 3 change to YOLO model and target name respectively, when the robot is in

                        This is a mode in which the robot act autonomously, it uses the camera to see the environment
                        and a deep learning (YOLO) model to detect objects. The robot spin on itself and if it sees the
                        target, moves towards it. hen it is close enough, it stops. It uses the lidar to know the
                        distance from the target.
